            <p>I went to Uppsala, Sweden for my semester abroad in Winter 2024. Although Uppsala wasn’t my first choice (for obvious reasons… it’s freezing!), I found lasting friendships, thriving student culture, and a unique and unforgettable experience. <br><br>

              I initially was assigned to the student accommodation Flogsta, which is a form of communal living in corridors. Around 12 people in a corridor, who share living spaces like the kitchen, but all have private rooms and bathrooms. After reading online reviews and speaking with previous exchange students, it seemed Flogsta would be the perfect place to build community and make friends as an incoming exchange student who didn’t really know anyone. <br><br>
              
              I arrived in Uppsala in early January and was immediately met with my first challenge. After a long 14-hour travel day from Southern California, I stumbled into my Flogsta corridor, weary with exhaustion. The reality is, the place was just nasty. It hadn’t been cleaned from previous tenants and it looked like what I would describe as a prison frat house. Long story short, the housing company was kind enough to move me to a new accommodation the next day. I was so relieved! <br><br>
              
              I moved into my apartment in Klostergatan 16 and was so excited, the only downside being that I was now going to be living alone–no corridor or roommates. Although this made me nervous, it was the better alternative and I knew that with time, I would make plenty of friends regardless of where I lived.

            <h2>Exploring Uppsala's Cafes & Fika</h2>
            <p>Uppsala is the 4th largest city in Sweden, yet has such a small, unique feel to it. I was antsy to start exploring and soon had a developing list of my favorite cafes and restaurants in town. <i>Fika</i> was one of the Swedish traditions I was most excited about. <br><br>

              <i>Fika – A Swedish cultural tradition, essentially a coffee break with a social and relaxing emphasis. It involves taking a break from work or other activities, enjoying coffee or tea with a sweet treat (like a pastry or cookie), and socializing. Fika can happen at any time during the day, alone or with others, and is a way to slow down and appreciate the simple pleasures of life.</i> <br><br>
              
              Is that not the most amazing thing you’ve ever heard? Best part I found out about Fika was that we literally had Fika breaks in the middle of class! The Swedes stay really caffeinated… <br><br>

            <h2>Student Life in Uppsala – The Nations</h2>
            <p>One of the best things about being a student in Uppsala are the <i>Nations</i>. <br><br>

              <i>Nations – In Swedish universities, "nations" refer to student organizations that have historical roots in a system of regional or diocesan student associations. These nations are found at Uppsala University and Lund University, and historically at other Swedish universities. While membership is now voluntary, nations provide social and cultural activities, and some students still identify strongly with their nation.</i> <br><br>
              
              Nation culture is strong at Uppsala University, making up most of the student social life. My fellow exchange students and I found this out quickly, and made sure to join one or two for a small membership fee (~$30). The nations are beautiful buildings scattered around the cities–Uppsala has 13 active nations! I joined Södermanlands-Nerikes Nation, otherwise known as “Snerikes.” Snerikes is one of the largest nations in Uppsala and very popular among exchange students. It also had the best nightclub. <br><br>
              Nations are similar to fraternity and sorority life in the United States, but with a few tweaks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Nations are co-ed
                <li>You can be a member of as many nations as you want and there’s no recruitment process</li>
                <li>Events are open to all, no matter your nation membership</li> 
                <li>Nations have cafes, pubs, and nightclubs within their buildings that students frequent weekly</li>
                <li>Students can work at the nations and make money (even exchange students!)</li>
                <li>Optional living requirement</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Aside from frequenting the cafes, pubs, and nightclubs that nations offer, they also put on formal dinner events called <i>gasques</i>. <br><br>
              <i>Gasque – A Gasque in Sweden is a traditional student party, often referred to as a formal student dinner. It's a social event that typically includes a themed dinner, formal attire, speeches, and songs, usually hosted by student nations at universities like Uppsala University.</i> <br><br>

              Although I was a member of Snerikes officially, I spent a lot of time in almost every nation in some way or another. Below is a quick review of some Uppsala’s nations that I frequented. Note: These are generalizations from my experience as an exchange student and definitely don’t reflect everyone’s experience with Uppsala’s nation life.
            </p>
            <h3>Södermanlands-Nerikes Nation (Snerikes)</h3>
            <p>Snerikes’ nightclub is every Tuesday and is (arguably) the best night of the week. Students line up for hours outside of Snerikes to get in (especially in the beginning and end of the semester) and spend the night dancing away on one of their 3 dance floors. Also, Snerikes is literally a pink castle.
            </p>

            <figcaption>Snerikes Nation</figcaption>
            <h3>Kalmar Nation</h3>
            <p>Many of my friends were members of Kalmar! Kalmar had a very laid back, alternative/hipster vibe. They had a lot of fun, unique events and we spent a lot of time playing board games in their pub. Also attended their Vårbal (Spring Ball) which was beautiful and so much fun!</p>
            <h3>Västgöta Nation (VG)</h3>
            <p>Västgöta was known for their soup lunch. Every weekday, they make a different soup and serve it with the best focaccia bread you’ll ever have. It was the cheapest lunch you could find in Uppsala, coming in at $5. We attended soup lunch every single week. Obsessed. When the weather got warm, we sat outside in the sun and enjoyed our soup with friends!
            </p>
            <h3>Smålands Nation</h3>
            <p>My friends and I went to Smålands every Wednesday night for their pub quiz. This quickly became a weekly tradition that we LOVED. The quiz was very popular and we had to email Monday at 12:00am each week to get a spot for our team. Our team name was “Soup” (can you guess why??). We ended the semester ranked 13th (this was an accomplishment).
            </p>
            <h3>Stockholms Nation</h3>
            <p>Stockholms nation was another very large nation at Uppsala. They had their nightclub on Thursdays which was also very popular and huge on the inside. Their cafe was super yummy (great pasta and paninis) and they had a beer garden outside at the end of the semester. Stockholms was another staple nation we attended frequently!
            </p>
            <h3>Värmlands Nation</h3>
            <p>Värmlands club was on Fridays (are you sensing a theme here?). Although we didn’t attend every week, it was always a great switch up and the music never disappointed. They also had a huge outdoor area, which was perfect for Valborg. We attended Värmlands’ Valborg and it was amazing!
            </p>

            <p><i>Valborg – Valborg, also known as Walpurgis Night, is a Swedish tradition celebrated on the night of April 30th to mark the arrival of spring and the end of winter. It's a time for bonfires, music, and festivities. Valborg in Uppsala is one of Sweden's largest folk festivals and attracts over 120,000 visitors each year. The city is filled with classical traditions, student life and music - a unique mix of herring lunches, rafting, hat-wearing, choir singing and spontaneous celebrations.</i> <br><br>
              Valborg was a Swedish holiday that was a 3-5 day celebration for the students in Uppsala. We bought tickets for Värmlands’ valborg and attended each night. Värmlands had an awesome outdoor setup, with a different DJ each night. Valborg was when the weather finally shifted. We were so excited for Spring! Another great Valborg tradition in Uppsala is the boat races in the river and spending the day in Ekonomikum Park.

            <h2>Academic Life at Uppsala University</h2>
            <p>I know it sounds like all I did abroad was go to Snerikes and eat soup, but I also went to class! I studied abroad through the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI) Abroad program. This meant that I was attending the equivalent school at Uppsala, which was the School of Information Technology. Some of my classes I took included Computational Social Science, Human-Robot Interaction, Future of Technology and Sustainability, and American Pop Music. All of my courses were very interesting and structured very differently from Michigan’s courses. Most of my courses were with other exchange students as well, and even Master’s students at Uppsala.

            <p>One thing I really enjoyed while abroad was filming vlogs and puting them on YouTube. You can find some of my vlogs below about my time in Uppsala!

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Uppsala surprised me in all the best ways. I never expected that a small city in eastern Sweden would come to feel like a second home—but it did. The friendships I formed there have outlived our time together, and the memories are ones I’ll carry with me for life. <br> <br>

              For a long time, I struggled to put Uppsala’s spirit into words. When people asked, “What was Sweden like? How was studying abroad?” I found myself at a loss. Uppsala is shaped by its quirks, traditions, and timeless charm. It exists in a moment, and part of its magic is knowing that moment can’t be replicated. I can go back and visit, retrace my steps, and remember—but I’ll never be a student there again. That’s what has really stuck with me. <br> <br>
              
              If you are a student wondering if Uppsala is the place for you, I encourage you to think about what you truly want out of your abroad experience. In Uppsala, I found deep cultural immersion, incredible friendships, and endless fun. I hope you do too!
