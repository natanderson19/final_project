            <p>My trip to Prague was the first of many travels during my semester abroad. I went with 3 friends from home–Ella, Monique, and Caroline. Prague ended up being one of my favorite cities I have ever visited! I didn’t know much about Prague prior to our trip, which made for a really exciting, spontaneous trip.

            <h2>Where to Stay in Prague</h2>
            <p>Our hostel in Prague was amazing. For anyone traveling with friends or traveling solo, this hostel had everything we needed and more for a very reasonable price. The only downfall was that the hostel was a bit outside of where we spent a lot of our time, so we had to take some cabs to and from (cabs were cheap so not a problem!)

            <h2>What to Do in prague</h2>
            <h3>Walk the Charles bridge at sunset
            </h3>
            <p>The Charles Bridge was hands-down my favorite part of Prague. We walked it so many times and the view is something I’ll never forget.
            </p>
            <h3>Visit the Prague castle grounds</h3>
            <p>If you're up for the climb, the castle grounds are worth every step. Wandering through the courtyards and looking out over the city from the top was one of the best views we found.</p>

<h3>Shop vintage stores</h3>
<p>Prague’s Old Town is full of hidden gems when it comes to vintage shops and souvenir spots. We spent hours thrifting and digging through quirky little stores.</p>

<h3>Get a chimney cake</h3>
<p>They might be touristy, but they’re still so good. Definitely worth trying at least once.</p>

<h3>Experience the nightlife</h3>
<p>The nightlife in Prague was so much fun and there’s something for every vibe. Dog Bar is this eclectic underground spot with great energy, definitely worth checking out. We also did the Drunken Monkey bar crawl (chaos. I heard recently they shut it down?) and tried Anonymous Shrink’s Office, a speakeasy with a secret entrance and a super creative cocktail menu.</p>

          <p>Hi! I'm Natalie, a UX Design student at the University of Michigan. This site is my final project for SI 339.
