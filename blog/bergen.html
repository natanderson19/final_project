            <p>Bergen, Norway is a charming coastal city surrounded by breathtaking mountains and fjords. The city’s colorful and historic Bryggen Wharf, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of its most iconic landmarks. Once a center for Hanseatic trade, these wooden buildings now house boutiques, cafes, and museums. Notably, it is the birthplace of composer Edvard Grieg (as a pianist, this is cool to me!).

            <br><br>I traveled to Bergen in late April of 2024 with my two close friends I met during my time abroad in Uppsala–Lucia and Nikki. After lots of back and forth, we landed on visiting Bergen for the weekend.

            <h2>Where to stay in Bergen</h2>
            <p>We found the best, most affordable option for us was to book an AirBnb. There were plenty of options, all great quality! We landed on one just above the Stølen neighborhood in walking distance of Bergenhus, or the harbor. I will say that when we booked, we were unaware of how hilly Bergen is… our walk back to the accommodation was more like a climb. Regardless, it was worth it for the view.

            <h2>what to do in bergen</h2>
            <h3>Take a Fjord Cruise</h3>
            <p>We did the 4 hour fjord cruise to Mostraumen and it was incredible. The sights along the way were some of the most stunning landscapes I’ve ever seen. Steep cliffs, narrow passages, and waterfalls cascading straight into the fjord. If you're visiting Bergen, a fjord tour is 100% worth it and one of the best ways to experience Norway’s natural beauty up close.</p>

            <h3>Walk around Bryggen</h3>
            <p>One of our favorite parts of Bergen was walking around Bryggen. This historic area along the wharf is full of charm, with narrow alleyways, leaning wooden buildings, and vibrant colors. We spent a good chunk of time exploring the small boutiques and souvenir shops tucked inbetween the buildings. It’s a great spot to pick up something unique (we all bought prints from a local artist). </p>

            <h3>Check out the fish market</h3>
            <p>Fisketorget is right on the waterfront and makes for a greatP stop, especially around lunchtime or if you’re craving sushi. It’s a mix of a traditional open-air market and a modern indoor food hall and super cool to walk around!</p>
            
            <h3>Take the funicular to Fløyen</h3>
            <p>It’s a quick ride up the mountain and gives you one of the best views of BergPen. At the top, you can walk along hiking trails, enjoy the peaceful forest paths, and even hang the friendly goats that just wander around freely (yes, you can pet them). If you keep walking a bit further, there’s a small lake with a cozy café where you can grab Norwegian-style pancakes and relax by the water. Fløyen is a must.</p>
            
            <h3>Try Reindeer Sausage at Trekroneren</h3>
            <p>This hot dog stand from 1946 offers up some incredible sausages, surprisingly tasty topped with lingonberry sauce and crispy onions. A classic Bergen street food stop with other sausage options too. Delicious.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Our trip to Bergen was unforgettable. It was an easy trip from Sweden, but felt like a totally different environment—calmer, greener, and more laid-back. The colorful houses along the waterfront gave the city so much character. We loved walking through the outdoor markets and just taking in the views. <br><br>

            What stood out most was how seamlessly Bergen blends city life with nature. You’re always close to mountains, water, and greenery, which makes the whole place feel open and refreshing. It’s not as tourist-heavy as other European cities, which made it feel a bit more authentic. Bergen is off the beaten path and I highly recommend visiting it!
