            <p>Bergen, Norway is a charming coastal city surrounded by breathtaking mountains and fjords. The city’s colorful and historic Bryggen Wharf, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of its most iconic landmarks. Once a center for Hanseatic trade, these wooden buildings now house boutiques, cafes, and museums. Notably, it is the birthplace of composer Edvard Grieg (as a pianist, this is cool to me!).

            <br><br>I traveled to Bergen in late April of 2024 with my two close friends I met during my time abroad in Uppsala–Lucia and Nikki. After lots of back and forth, we landed on visiting Bergen for the weekend.

            <h2>Where to stay in Bergen</h2>
            <p>We found the best, most affordable option for us was to book an AirBnb. There were plenty of options, all great quality! We landed on one just above the Stølen neighborhood in walking distance of Bergenhus, or the harbor. I will say that when we booked, we were unaware of how hilly Bergen is… our walk back to the accommodation was more like a climb. Regardless, it was worth it for the view.
